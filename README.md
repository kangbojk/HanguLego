    Future maybe ðŸ˜Ž

## Design Concept
The crafting of this tool roused during my journey of self-taugt Korean. 
According to Sejong the Great(creator/compiler of Hangul), 

> "A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days."

, but after a month, I  couldn't memorise hangul. 

Instead of giving up or switching to hangul romanization, I came up with an idea, make a tool that help reinforcing hangul's pronunciation. 


I took the concept of LEGO, when ever I want to search a word, I need to drag consonants and vowels to construct the Korean word. HanguLego will speak out the pronunication of the hangul you're dragging.

Since the Hangul structure is scientific, adding colors to different parts of hangul that compose a word may be helpful for memorising the word.
Keep in mind that HanguLego is not meant to be a dictionary, but a learning tool that help you conquer the Korean Learning Advantage.

Once I find any useful learning tracking approach, HanguLego could be equipped with progressing feature, feel free to reach out if you have any ideas!
